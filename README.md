# The-Egg-Catcher
This is an 'Egg Catching Game' using python as programming language. The eggs fall from the sky into a basket near the 
ground . The sun gives the score, and the lives are 3. As you miss one egg the lives reduce and when you catch an egg
you earn 10 points.When the lives remaining are 0 ,the game displays a message box with the message 'Game Over' and 
the 'final score'. The GUI used is 'tkinter' and the libraries used are itertools and random. Tk() function displays 
the window , canvas() creates a canvas and other functions used are create_arc(),create_text(),create_rectangle(),
create_oval,coords(),itemconfigure(),config(),after(),move(),bind(),focus_set()displays the interface. Cycle() from 
itertools ensures that the eggs come in a cycle of different colors. The randomrange() function generates random numbers
from where the eggs are falling.
